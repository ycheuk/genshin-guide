# Genshin Guide

- **Status:** Work in Progress

- **How to Access:** Simply click the link: [Genshin Guide](https://ycheuk.github.io/genshin-guide/)
- **Feedback:** Please give feedback on what I should improve before I move forward with other characters. This can be design-wise, what looks off or not great, suggestions for improvement, or if a particular section seems off due to screen size differences.
- **How This Was Built:** Front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Feel free to explore the guide and provide feedback to help improve the user experience. Thank you!
